# TODO: Add Comments and Reactions to Home Page Posts

## Tasks
- [x] Update database_schema.sql to add reactions table
- [x] Add reaction functions to app/lib/supabase.ts
- [x] Modify app/routes/home.tsx to display and allow adding comments and reactions for each post
- [x] Test the functionality

## Notes
- Comments table already exists in schema and functions in supabase.ts
- Reactions need to be added from scratch
- Each post should show comments and allow adding new ones
- Reactions could be like/dislike or emoji-based
